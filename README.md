## Installation
In order to use this program you first have to run 'npm install inquirer'. That will install the inquirer package which is required for my program to work. Then you just have to call it from the cmd line, by calling node index.js from the directory you downloaded it to.

## Usage
You are free to use this software without crediting me in any capacity.
